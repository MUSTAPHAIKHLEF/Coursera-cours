        <img src="mypicture.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="images">&quot;Okay, so we're looking at images.html,
     which is located in the examples Lecture10 folder. And you may
     recognize this file from a few lectures ago where this is a 
     famous quote from Theodore Roosevelt. And, by the way, I apologize, 
     I made a typo before. Theodore Roosevelt is spelled with an E.
     So for you eagle eyes out there who noticed that I misspelled
     Theodore I apologize. It was just a typo. Anyway our task
     here is to display an image right before the quote itself. 
     And we actually have a couple of images here. And since I wanted
     to start with one, let me comment this one out, and at the same time 
     show you what an HTML comment looks like. And it's pretty simple, it 
     starts with a less than bracket, exclamation point, dash, dash,
     and then it gets closed with a dash, dash, right angle bracket.
     And what will happen when you load this page into.&quot;
